            <p class="font-display text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight text-slate-900">“How to scam people.” is
                a book that teaches you a simple method to start scamming people.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">Before I learned how to scam people myself, I always imagined those who fall for scams as naive or gullible individuals who are easily tricked.
                 They picture a con artist slyly talking their way into someone's trust, then manipulating them into handing over their money or personal information.
                Others imagine it happening to older people who are not tech-savvy, or to individuals who are in a vulnerable financial situation and desperate for a quick fix. 
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                However, the truth is that scams can happen to anyone, regardless of age, intelligence, or financial stability. 
                Scammers are becoming more sophisticated in their tactics, using psychological tricks and technological tools to target their victims. 
                It's important to stay vigilant and educated about the different types of scams to avoid falling prey to them.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">In “How to scam people”, you’ll learn all about how to not get scammed the next time hopefully, and you'll learn basic skills a con artist have.</p>
